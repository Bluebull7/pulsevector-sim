# PulseVector

PulseVector is an experimental system built around decision-making under constraint.

It uses finance, accounting, and systems design as the medium, but not the objective.

---

## Motivation

In many leadership and development settings, decisions are discussed more often than they are experienced.

Outcomes are usually explained after the fact, or isolated from the conditions that produced them.

PulseVector explores a different approach:
- decisions are made sequentially
- constraints persist
- consequences accumulate
- structure is not abstracted away

---

## Archetypes

The entry point into the system is an archetype selection.

Participants begin from a particular lens:
- banker
- accountant
- financial modeler
- controller

Each archetype reflects a set of tendencies:
- what is noticed early
- what is deferred
- how risk is interpreted
- how pressure is handled

No archetype is treated as neutral.

## The Ledger

All decisions ultimately resolve into a live accounting ledger.

Cash, liabilities, timing, and recognition are not simulated as scores or hidden variables.

They are recorded directly.

The ledger is not explained in advance.
It is observed over time.

---

## Use

This project is being explored as a development and reflection tool.

It may be relevant in contexts involving:
- early leadership roles
- student organizations
- training environments
- mentorship settings

The emphasis is on observation and reflection rather than optimization.

---

## Status

- Archetype initialization
- Real ledger-backed actions
- Scenario scaffolding in progress

The system is incomplete by design.
